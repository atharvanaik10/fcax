#Final Cut Amateur X
######_(Because why pay $300?)_

Are you really bad at filming on your ridiculously expensive phone? Fret not, because FCAX will (attempt to) stabilize 
your video and color correct it for you! You'll get Roger Deakins like cinematography in no time!

On a more serious note, FCAX is a C++ application that uses OpenCV to stabilize and color correct videos. 
It's built with a [Cinder](libcinder.org) user interface. 

##Handling OpenCV 
You'll need to have OpenCV installed on your machine. The steps below show how to do that if you need to.

If you already have Homebrew installed, you can use the command ```brew install opencv```

To install homebrew, type this in your terminal (more information [here](brew.sh)): 
```/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"```

##Using the App
Once you've installed OpenCV, you should be ready to go. Open the project in your favourite IDE,
and run "final-cut-amateur-x."
